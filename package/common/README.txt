### Installing
1. Extract NotBlood to a new directory
2. Copy the following files from Blood 1.21 to NotBlood folder:

   BLOOD.INI
   BLOOD.RFF
   BLOOD000.DEM, ..., BLOOD003.DEM (optional)
   CP01.MAP, ..., CP09.MAP (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   CPART07.AR_ (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   CPART15.AR_ (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   CPBB01.MAP, ..., CPBB04.MAP (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   CPSL.MAP (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   CRYPTIC.INI (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   CRYPTIC.SMK (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   CRYPTIC.WAV (optional, Cryptic Passage)
   GUI.RFF
   SOUNDS.RFF
   SURFACE.DAT
   TILES000.ART, ..., TILES017.ART
   VOXEL.DAT

3. Optionally, if you want to use CD audio tracks instead of MIDI, provide FLAC/OGG recordings in following format: bloodXX.flac/ogg, where XX is track number. Make sure to enable Redbook audio option in sound menu.
4. Optionally, if you want cutscenes and you have the original CD, copy the `movie` folder into NotBlood's folder (the folder itself too).
If you have the GOG version of the game, do the following:
   - make a copy of `game.ins` (or `game.inst`) named `game.cue`
   - mount the `.cue` as a virtual CD (for example with `WinCDEmu`)
   - copy the `movie` folder from the mounted CD into NotBlood's folder
5. Launch NotBlood (on Linux, to play Cryptic Passage, launch with the `-ini CRYPTIC.INI` parameter)

### Vanilla Mode
This feature sets the game to match v1.21 DOS compatibility, and removes any bugs fixes that come with NBlood/NotBlood
The vanilla mode option can be found within game settings, and is only available for single-player
It should be noted that vanilla mode does not work with modern maps

### Mutator Options
* Replace guns akimbo with quad damage
   - Replaces the guns akimbo powerup with Quake's quad damage (lasts 22 seconds)
* Player damage invulnerability
   - Apply a short invulnerability state for the player for bullet hitscans/spirit/tesla damage
   - Invulnerability duration changes depending on damage taken scale/current health (lower health = longer invulnerability state)
* Explosions behavior
   - Replace the default vanilla explosion calculation with an new improved sector scanning system
   - Fixes rare cases where enemies appear to ignore explosive damage due to sector/span order
   - Includes two methods to choose from: NotBlood (check linked sectors once) and Raze (always check linked sectors)
* Projectiles behavior (NotBlood)
   - For all missiles/projectiles, use the more accurate eduke32's clipmove() function
   - Player missiles/projectile hitboxes have been reduced so it's easier to throw/target around corners
   - Run raymarching checks on player projectiles to ensure they do not clip through enemies/geometry
   - When spawning player projectiles, it'll do a alpha pixel check for initial hitscan that return a non-dude sprite hit (e.g: throwing TNT up close to the tree sprites in CPSL.MAP)
* Projectiles behavior (Raze)
   - For all missiles/projectiles, use the more accurate eduke32's clipmove() function
   - Leave all hitbox sizes as original
* Napalm gravity falloff
   - For player spawned napalm projectiles, make gravity affect their trajectory path
* Enemy behavior (NBlood)
   - Fixes various original 1.21 bugs with enemies such as:
   - Tiny Caleb using the wrong burning sprite
   - Enemies sometimes burning indefinitely
   - Ignited cultists switching weapons when extinguished in water
   - Cerberus spinning uselessly on lava
   - Check if enemy is alive before setting target for AI
   - Fixes tesla cultists bugged prone attack sequence

   - Limit impulse damage when shooting enemies downward at point-blank
   - Cheogh blasting/attacking can now hit prone players (only for well done and above difficulties)
   - Fix Beast state when leaving water sector
   - Restore unused fall animations for cultists
* Random cultist TNT
   - This will make cultists use a variety of random thrown sprites such as:
   - Napalm balls, proxy bundles, armed spray cans or pod projectiles
* Weapon behavior
   - Select between original weapon behavior, NBlood's V1.X behavior or NotBlood's tweaked weapon set which include:
   - Tommy gun alt fire uses autoaim
   - Autoaim is always enabled for pitchfork
   - Make beast vision see through nearby walls
   - Adjust pitch offset for spray/missile firing
   - Adds a charge up stab for pitchfork's alt fire
   - Lifeleech steals enemy's health (like V1.X behavior)
   - Makes lifeleech throwable and increases damage while in sentry mode
   - Do double melee damage if attacking enemies from 45 degrees behind
   - Allows tesla projectiles to be reflected back with reflective shots powerup
   - Adds a special alt fire missile attack for pitchfork's charge up while quad damage is active

* Sector behavior
   - Fixes room over room sector handling with hitscan calculations
   - Allow hitscan weapons to be fired when floating above water
   - Prevent missiles from colliding with water surface sectors
   - Fix water/blood droplets transitioning through underwater (e.g: the cave secret in CP01.MAP)
   - Fixes blood splatter not using closest sector
   - Improves FX sprite handling regarding room over room transitioning
   - Check wall collision for spent bullet casings movement
   - Allow spent bullet casings to use water sector links

   - Lower gravity of bullet casings and gibs underwater
   - Add player's velocity to spawned bullet casings
   - Make blood splatter/flare gun glow effect slope on sloped surfaces
   - Prevent glow effects from rendering over room over room surfaces
   - Add room over room sector transversal for shadow rendering
   - Support wall sprites moving along with elevators
   - Fix bullet hole being placed across sky tile walls
   - Use Raze phase calculation for smoother elevator rides
* Hitscan projectiles
   - Makes enemies that use hitscan bullets spawn physical sprite based bullets with travel time
   - Projectile speed is adjusted if bullet is underwater (25% speed penalty)
   - This mutator does not support custom modern map enemies
* Randomizer mode
   - Set the enemy/pickups randomizer mode
